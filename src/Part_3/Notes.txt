Functional Interfaces and lambda Expression

Understand what is Imperative VS Declarative VS Functional Programming

### 🧠 **Imperative vs Declarative vs Functional Programming**

#### **1️⃣ Imperative Programming**

* **Meaning:** You tell *how* to do things — step-by-step instructions.
* **Focus:** *How to achieve* the result.
* **Example:** Using loops, conditions, and variable updates manually.
* **Java Example:**

  ```java
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      sum += i;
  }
  System.out.println(sum);
  ```

#### **2️⃣ Declarative Programming**

* **Meaning:** You tell *what* you want — not *how* to do it.
* **Focus:** *What result* you want.
* **Example:** SQL, Streams, LINQ — express logic, not control flow.
* **Java Example (using Stream API):**

  ```java
  int sum = IntStream.range(0, 5).sum();
  ```

---

#### **3️⃣ Functional Programming**

* **Meaning:** A subset of declarative programming — focuses on using *pure functions* and *immutability*.
* **Focus:** Functions as first-class citizens, avoid changing state.
* **Java Example:**

  ```java
  List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
  int sum = nums.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
  ```

### ⚖️ **Difference Summary**

| Concept         | Focus                      | Example Style      | State Change | Approach            |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| **Imperative**  | *How to do it*             | Loops, conditions  | Yes          | Step-by-step        |
| **Declarative** | *What to do*               | SQL, Streams       | No           | Describe result     |
| **Functional**  | *Functions & Immutability* | Lambda, Stream API | No           | Uses pure functions |


Functional Interface

Basic difference is that an Interface can contain many abstract,default or static method.
For the Functional interface you can have only one Abstract method and multiple default and static method.
We can annotate the Interface functional interface with @FunctionalInterface(Forces to maintain functional Interface).

Pro Tip - If an Interface contains no methods then it is Marker Interface

By Use of the Lambda expressions the functional interface abstract method will be implemented. An Instance
for the implementation will be created and used.

Main Purpose of the Functional Interface is to create Single functionality implementation that
will be implemented with Lambda expression.

Lambda Expression:

With the Lambda Expression we are going to Implement the single abstract method in the Interface
also that will help to create an instance of the abstract method of the Functional Interface

Syntax:

Method without Parameter

() -> {code block}

Method without Parameter

(parameter names) -> {code block}

We can Instantiate this Functional Interface abstract method any number of times with different object reference
names.

For More than one parameter it is same concept just we need to pass the (number of parameters).
Also, the instead of (int x, int y) can be written as (x,y) and automatically taken appropriately.
If the return is single statement we can ignore the curly braces

(x,y) -> x*y;

From the lambda instance created we can also call the default methods also.
As usual the static methods  are only called from the Interface.staticMethod only.
