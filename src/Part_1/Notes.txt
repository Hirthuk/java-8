Default and Static Methods in Interfaces

Default Methods:

Until Java 7 We can able to create only abstract methods in Interfaces. From Java 8 onwards
We can create default and static methods in Interface. This methods can have implementation in it.

We can create any number of abstract methods in an Interface - Even before Java 8
We can create any number of default methods in an Interface

Usage of Default Methods in Interface
You can keep any number of default methods in an Interface and make use of it just by chaning the
Interface methods so it will update all the implemented classes.

To Create and access the default methods in Java 8
Create an Interface with abstract methods(Optional if not created it will be Market Interface(No methods inside the Interface))
Create a or more(as wish) method in the Interface with default key word.
create a class that implements and overrides the abstract methods in the Interface.

Accessing:
Create an Object for the Interface Implemented class in the same class or another class.Call the Methods from the object.
You can also call the default methods in the Interface implementing classes inside the overridden methods.
