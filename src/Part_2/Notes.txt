Static methods inside an Interface

In Java Static methods not belongs to any object.

By That said we cannot be able to access the methods by creating the object then object.method()

So We can call the static implemented method in the interface by InterfaceName.staticMethod()

We won't be getting any issues like same method Signature in Different Interface. Since we are going
to call the method with the Interface name there won't be any issues.

InterFaceName.sameMethod()
InterFaceName2.sameMethod()


For Example There are use cases in Interfaces like List where they using this default  and static methods
