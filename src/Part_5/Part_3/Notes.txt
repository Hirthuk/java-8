Consumer Functional Interface

Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
Unlike most other functional interfaces, Consumer is expected to operate via side-effects.
This is a functional interface whose functional method is accept(Object).

Contains two methods called

accept(Object) -> Abstract method

andThen() -> Default method

UseCases:

When u just want to do some operations but don't want to return anything like adding or removing
data from the list like that.

In foreach loops like list it is expecting Consumer FI as input. We can specify the logic in that and
it will apply to all the elements

andThen() -> Default method - This one is same as Function FI andThen() but it doesn't return value

This means you can have one Consumer FI instance that does something.. after is completing you want to
execute another Consumer FI instance(Important only takes Consumer FI instance)

andThen() → runs the first consumer, then the second consumer on the same input.

Consumer<String> printName = name -> System.out.println("Name: " + name);

        // Second consumer prints the name length
        Consumer<String> printLength = name -> System.out.println("Length: " + name.length());

        // Chaining both consumers using andThen
        Consumer<String> combined = printName.andThen(printLength);

        // Execute both in order
        combined.accept("Sharan");
