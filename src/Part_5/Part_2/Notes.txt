Predicate Functional Interface

Predicate Functional Interface have one abstract method called test.
Predicate is used to test and return the boolean value based on the condition.

Predicate<Class> functionName = e -> e > 21; Lambda expression to return boolean

test method is the abstract method that will be used.

functionName.test(23)

Default Methods in Predicate

This is very simple and similar to Logical operator

Default methods

and -> Similar to && PredicateFunction1.and(anotherPredicate).test(Class object) -> both true return true

or -> Similar to || PredicateFunction1.or(anotherPredicate).test(Class object) -> Any one is true return true

negate ->  Similar to ! PredicateFunction1.negate().test(Class object) ->return opposite

isEqual -> Similar to = PredicateFunction1.test() ->return true if equal
This isEqual will be using this public static boolean equals(Object a, Object b) method to verify.
Where the Object a will be declared while creating and object b will be compared.

If you want to use it for other Class object comparison like  Employee with difference compare you
have to override the method in that Class. One when you want different comparison logic

Sine it is a static class we have to use Predicate.isEquals() while declaring. isEquals(Object Ref)

See Implementation.
